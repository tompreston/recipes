title: "Spaghetti Carbonara"
---

## Ingredients
* 100 g pancetta (Bacon works too)
* 50 g / 100 g parmesan
* 50 g pecorino
* 3 whole eggs
* 350 g spaghetti
* 2 whole garlic clove (Peeled and squashed)
* 50 g butter

## Steps
* Boil water.
* Finely chop the pancetta.
* Grate and mix cheeses.
* Beat the eggs and season with grated black pepper.
* Boil spaghetti until al dente (10 mins). (Season by adding 1 tsp salt to water first)
* Fry butter, pancetta and squashed garlic cloves, until golden (5 mins). Then remove the garlic.
* Turn off the heat.
* Scoop the spaghetti into the pan with a bit of the hot pasta water. Save the rest of the water.
* Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
* Pour in the eggs and cheese and mix. Don't scramble the eggs.
* Add pasta water to keep it saucy (a few tablespoons will do).
* Season with salt and pepper.
* Twist onto plates to serve. Season with salt, pepper, cheese.

## Notes
* The trick is to avoid scrambling the eggs and using the pasta water to keep it saucy.
