title: "Martini"

## Ingredients
* 3 parts / 37.5 ml gin
* 2 parts / 25 ml vermouth
* 1 whole olive (Traditionally an olive, but subtitute with lemon, pickled onion, or whatever)

## Steps
* Cool glass
* Mix gin and vermouth in ice
* Strain into glass
* Garnish

## Notes
* Needs to be ice cold. Just mix and serve it with ice if you're feeling lazy* I'm not really a Martini drinker. Adjust the quantities to taste, this is just how I liked it... once.  Traditionally 6 parts gin and 1 part vermouth (eurgh!)
